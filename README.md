## The Current Raspberry Pi Model/(s) I own

29th Nov 2018, I ordered from off Amazon.co.uk the 'latest' Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+; which is a 'single board computer' that I aim to use to learn coding: C/Python/Scratch/Bash Scripting/-etc.; as well as, practice doing all kinds of other experiments relating to Networking/Electronics/-etc.; which are fields I still don't know, yet?
