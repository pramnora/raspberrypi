## The Current Raspberry Pi Model/(s) I own

29th Nov 2018, I ordered from off Amazon.co.uk the 'latest' Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+; which is a 'single board computer' that I aim to use to learn coding: 
- Assembly
- C
- Python
- Scratch
- Bash Scripting
- NodeJS
- etc.  
...as well as, practice doing all kinds of other experiments relating to:
- Networking
- Electronics
- etc.  
...which are fields I still don't know, yet?

## SSH/Secure Shell

SSH, allows one to log in remotely and control the Raspberry Pi...from any other computer inside of your own Network.  

*Method 1...*    
- Raspberry Terminal: sudo raspi config (allows one to set up SSH)
- download Putty (allows you to see/operate only the text based terminal)
- download xming (allows you to see/operated the Windows, as well)

*Method 2...*    
- Raspberry Terminal: sudo apt-get install xrdp
