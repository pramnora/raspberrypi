## The Current Raspberry Pi Model/(s) I own

29th Nov 2018, I ordered from off Amazon.co.uk the 'latest' Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+; which is a 'single board computer' that I aim to use to learn coding: 
- C
- Python
- Scratch
- Bash Scripting
- NodeJS
- etc.
...as well as, practice doing all kinds of other experiments relating to:
- Networking
- Electronics
- etc.
...which are fields I still don't know, yet?
